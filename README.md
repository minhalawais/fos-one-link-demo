## 🚀 Experience the Platform

The **One-Link Demo** is a high-fidelity, cinematic digital walkthrough designed to demonstrate the full capabilities of the **FOS Digital Grievance Management System**. 

Unlike a static presentation, this interactive application guides stakeholders, audio-visually, through the complete lifecycle of grievance handling—bridging the gap between factory workers and management through transparent, secure, and compliant processes.

## 🌟 Key Modules (The Journey)

The walkthrough is structured into four immersive modules, each highlighting a critical pillar of the FOS ecosystem:

### 1. ⚡ Deployment & Onboarding
*   **Rapid Digitalization**: Automated employee registration and validation.
*   **FOS IDs**: Unique digital identities for every worker, accessible via SMS.
*   **Awareness Cards**: Physical cards with reporting channels and instructions.
*   **Investigation Officers**: Role assignment for Root Cause Analysis (RCA) and evidence handling.

### 2. 🛡️ Complaint Intake & Registration
*   **Multi-Channel Reporting**: Toll-free hotline, WhatsApp, SMS, Email, and Mobile App.
*   **Inclusive Access**: Support for all literacy levels via trained grievance officers.
*   **Anonymous Reporting**: Secure channels for sensitive issues (Harassment, Discrimination).
*   **Instant Verification**: Unique ticket generation and real-time notifications for IOs.

### 3. 🔍 Investigation & Resolution
*   **Structured Workflow**: "In Process" → "Validity Assessment" → "RCA" → "CAPA".
*   **Root Cause Analysis (RCA)**: Deep-dive validity checks based on evidence and interviews.
*   **CAPA Planning**: Corrective & Preventive Action plans with assigned responsibilities.
*   **Satisfaction Loop**: Independent FOS verification with the complainant before case closure to ensure genuine resolution.

### 4. 📊 Dashboards & Risk Insights
*   **Real-Time Analytics**: Live tracking of open, overdue, and resolved cases.
*   **Category Heatmaps**: Identification of hotspots (e.g., Health & Safety, Wages).
*   **Performance Metrics**: Monitoring investigation quality and timeline adherence.
*   **Compliance Reporting**: Exportable data for EU CSDDD, LkSG, and ESG audits.
